# Manual check (M0)

Run this in a real, interactive Claude Code session. It covers what no headless run can: `/mcp`, Esc to cancel, and normal use of two upstreams through Polarizer. Each step gives the command, what to expect, and what to paste back if it differs. Run every command from `~/code/polarizer`.

## 1. Prepare

```
scripts/guard.sh snapshot
uv sync --locked
mkdir -p /tmp/polarizer-manual
echo "hello from the manual check" > /tmp/polarizer-manual/note.txt
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2026.8.31 /tmp/polarizer-manual < /dev/null
```

Expect the snapshot path, then `Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio`, and the prompt back within a few seconds. The `npx` line is the pre-warm: a first fetch can take longer than Polarizer's connect timeout. If it fails, paste its output.

## 2. polarizer.toml and .mcp.json

```
sed "s|/home/<you>|$HOME|g" polarizer.example.toml > polarizer.toml
sed "s|/home/<you>|$HOME|g" .mcp.json.example > .mcp.json
grep -A5 ledger_forbidden_paths polarizer.toml
git status --short
.venv/bin/polarizer verify --config "$HOME/code/polarizer/polarizer.toml"
```

Expect:
- `ledger_forbidden_paths` lists `~/code/parallax`, `~/code/parallax-backup-before-rewrite`, `~/code/loupe` and `~/code/isr`;
- `git status --short` prints nothing, because both files are gitignored;
- verify prints `no ledger at /home/<you>/.local/share/polarizer` (exit 2) the first time, or an `intact:` line if a ledger is already there.

If git lists either file, or verify prints anything else, paste the output.

## 3. Start Claude Code

```
claude
```

Claude Code asks whether to use the project's new MCP server `polarizer`; allow it. Approving it may update `~/.claude.json`, which is Claude Code's own bookkeeping. Then type `/mcp`.

Expect `polarizer` to show as connected, with 20 tools: `probe__wait`, `probe__crash`, `probe__env`, `probe__fail`, `probe__rich`, `probe__invalid`, and 14 `fs__` tools such as `fs__read_text_file` and `fs__list_directory_with_sizes`. Note how each name is shown, and whether any long name is shortened or cut. Paste the tool list as `/mcp` shows it, and say whether anything was shortened.

## 4. Use both servers

Ask Claude:

> Using the polarizer tools, list /tmp/polarizer-manual, read note.txt there, then call probe__wait with 2 seconds.

Expect the file listing, the text `hello from the manual check`, and `waited 2 s`. If a call fails, paste the error Claude shows.

## 5. Esc during a long call

Ask Claude:

> Call probe__wait with 30 seconds.

Press Esc about 5 seconds after the call starts. Then, in another terminal:

```
grep -n 'notifications/cancelled\|stopped after cancel' /tmp/polarizer-probe.log
tail -n 2 ~/.local/share/polarizer/ledger.jsonl
```

Expect a `notifications/cancelled` line within about 2 seconds of the Esc, then `call <id> stopped after cancel`, and a last ledger entry `call.returned` with `"outcome":"cancelled"`. This is still unverified: Claude Code may send no cancel for Esc. Paste both outputs whatever they show, and roughly when you pressed Esc.

## 6. A hung upstream (optional)

Exit Claude Code. Add this to the end of `polarizer.toml`:

```toml
[upstream.hung]
command = "sleep"
args = ["3600"]
connect_timeout_seconds = 5
```

Start `claude` again and type `/mcp`. Expect `polarizer` connected within about 10 seconds, with the same 20 tools and no `hung__` tools. If it takes longer or fails, paste what `/mcp` shows. Then exit Claude Code and remove those four lines again.

## 7. Verify the ledger

Exit Claude Code, then:

```
.venv/bin/polarizer verify --config "$HOME/code/polarizer/polarizer.toml"
```

Expect output in this form, with your own numbers:

```
intact: 31 entries, 2 sessions, 12 calls
chain 5f0c9e2a7b14d3e8a1c6f9b2d4e7a0c3, head <64 hex> at seq 30
```

Any other first line, or a nonzero exit, means paste the output.

## 8. Guard

```
scripts/guard.sh check
```

Expect no changes in the guarded repos, Parallax's directories or the MCP config hashes. The `~/.claude.json` size and mtime line is informational, because Claude Code updates that file on every run. Paste the whole output.
